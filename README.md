# Airline Delay Analysis Using Python

## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing airline flight delay data to identify trends and factors contributing to delays.
The objective is to derive insights that can help improve airline operations and customer satisfaction.

## Tools & Technologies
- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Dataset
The dataset contains airline flight information including:
- Flight schedules
- Delay duration
- Airline details
- Operational factors

(Source: Public airline dataset)

## Data Cleaning & Preparation
- Handled missing values
- Removed duplicates
- Converted data types for analysis

## Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Delay distribution analysis
- Airline-wise delay comparison
- Time-based trend analysis
- Visual insights using plots

## Key Insights
- Peak hours show higher delay frequency
- Some airlines have consistently higher delays
- Operational factors significantly affect delays

## Business Impact
- Helps airlines optimize scheduling
- Supports data-driven operational decisions
- Improves service reliability
